This is also a data collection and sharing exercise by [Hazirah M](https://possiblyzebra.notion.site/Contact-Me-e88daff714834f3a9fac11413ed48b6). Some thoughts follow:

## Rationale

I have kept the data structures simple because:

* I want to update it easier on an almost daily basis, particularly during Brunei's second wave of COVID-19 transmission that started on 7th Aug 2021
* I'm not planning anything ambitious with the data
* I am out of practice with formal data collection so I want to start small!

I'm sharing the data anyway, as it still could be useful to others. Suggestions for improving data structure are welcome. Figuring it out as I go! [Contact me here](https://possiblyzebra.notion.site/Contact-Me-e88daff714834f3a9fac11413ed48b6).
